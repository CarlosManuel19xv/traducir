1
0:00:00.210 --> 0:00:04,740
Nuestro siguiente punto en agenda

2
0:00:04.740 --> 0:00:07,109
es la conferencia Creando un país innovador

3
0:00:07.109 --> 0:00:10,380
El formato será el siguiente, tendremos una

4
0:00:10.380 --> 0:00:15,599
presentación del señor John Kao

5
0:00:15.599 --> 0:00:17,400
de cuarenta y cinco minutos luego

6
0:00:17.400 --> 0:00:21,149
luego tendremos unos quince minutos de conversación

7
0:00:21.149 --> 0:00:24,149
durante esos quince minutos me van a hacer llegar

8
0:00:24.149 --> 0:00:27,509
la pregunta que ha sido seleccionada

9
0:00:27.509 --> 0:00:30,960
por el publico que esta asistiendo tanto en Facebook

10
0:00:30.960 --> 0:00:33,719
y en las redes sociales de una forma virtual a nuestro evento

11
0:00:33.719 --> 0:00:38,190
luego presentaremos una disertación adicional

12
0:00:38.190 --> 0:00:41,789
sobre el modelo 

13
0:00:41.789 --> 0:00:51,269
de innovación china, les pido que demos la entrada 

14
0:00:51.269 --> 0:01:01,360
al señor Kao con un caluroso aplauso

15
0:01:01.360 --> 0:01:06,040
Buenas tardes, estoy muy contento de estar en

16
0:01:06.040 --> 0:01:08,860
vuestro país hoy y sólo quiero que en una

17
0:01:08.860 --> 0:01:11,680
nota personal decir que hace 50 años

18
0:01:11.680 --> 0:01:16,270
mi padre fue una expedición científica a

19
0:01:16.270 --> 0:01:19,420
Machu Picchu para estudiar la fisiología de la

20
0:01:19.420 --> 0:01:22,240
respiración que era su campo y ahora

21
0:01:22.240 --> 0:01:24,370
tengo el placer de participar en

22
0:01:24.370 --> 0:01:27,580
su expedición hacia la alta

23
0:01:27.580 --> 0:01:30,790
innovación así que estoy muy contento de seguir

24
0:01:30.790 --> 0:01:33,220
una tradición familiar con ustedes aquí esta

25
0:01:33.220 --> 0:01:34,479
tarde

26
0:01:34.479 --> 0:01:39,190
He tenido muchos sobrenombres durante los últimos 25

27
0:01:39.190 --> 0:01:40,780
años que he estado trabajando en el

28
0:01:40.780 --> 0:01:44,650
campo de la innovación y puedo repetir la mayoría

29
0:01:44.650 --> 0:01:46,960
de ellos a ustedes porque son bastante educados.

30
300:01:46.960 --> 0:01:48,970
Ustedes saben que The Economist me llamó

31
0:01:48.970 --> 0:01:52,600
Mr. Creatividad, pero el apodo que

32
0:01:52.600 --> 0:01:54,640
me gusta lo mejor que quizás dará

33
0:01:54.640 --> 0:01:57,460
una idea del tipo de trabajo que hago

34
0:01:57.460 --> 0:02:00,970
provino de un compromiso con el gobierno de

35
0:02:00.970 --> 0:02:03,910
los EE.UU. después de un año de trabajo

36
0:02:03.910 --> 0:02:06,760
con una agencia particular se volvieron

37
0:02:06.760 --> 0:02:09,100
a mí y me dijeron que bien Sabes que no eres

38
0:02:09.100 --> 0:02:12,820
como la mayoría de nosotros pero

39
0:02:12.820 --> 0:02:15,340
entendemos lo que estás haciendo y

40
0:02:15.340 --> 0:02:17,380
decidimos darte un apodo

41
0:02:17.380 --> 0:02:24,340
que eres un "Innovador Sherpa" ahora

42
0:02:24.340 --> 0:02:26,950
supuesto que eres un país que sabe

0:02:26.950 --> 0:02:28,959
mucho sobre las montañas que traje una montaña

0:02:28.959 --> 0:02:29,709
conmigo

0:02:29.709 --> 0:02:31,720
Monte Everest montaña diferente pero

0:02:31.720 --> 0:02:34,390
pero cuando se sube a una montaña y no

0:02:34.390 --> 0:02:37,989
tiene un mapa que a menudo necesitan un guía y

0:02:37.989 --> 0:02:40,090
el guía con suerte tiene un mapa sabe cómo

0:02:40.090 --> 0:02:42,280
llegar a la cima de la montaña por lo que en

0:02:42.280 --> 0:02:45,280
mi propio trabajo de trabajo con las primeras empresas 

0:02:45.280 --> 0:02:48,519
con empresas maduras con los gobiernos de todo 

0:02:48.519 --> 0:02:49,750
el mundo.

0:02:49.750 --> 0:02:52.150
He sido capaz de armar mi propio

0:02:52.150 --> 0:02:57,010
mapa de cómo funciona el proceso laboral, cómo empezar 

0:02:57.010 --> 0:03:00,310
empresa de un país realmente se involucre 

0:03:00.310 --> 0:03:03,310
con la innovación y hace el trabajo de la

0:03:03.310 --> 0:03:06,160
innovación de esa manera. Soy muy clínico

0:03:06.160 --> 0:03:09,190
porque me gusta como digo mover a las personas

0:03:09.190 --> 0:03:11.560
y organizaciones de la comprensión

0:03:11.560 --> 0:03:12,170
del

0:03:12.170 --> 0:03:14,390
océano innovador. Que es lo que podría decir 

0:03:14.390 --> 0:03:17,209
para realmente conseguirlo

0:03:17.209 --> 0:03:19,640
Usted acaba de decir que la innovación es

0:03:19.640 --> 0:03:21,980
es importante que se obtiene a cierto plazo

0:03:21.980 --> 0:03:25,550
pero para mí la innovación es en realidad un conjunto muy

0:03:25.550 --> 0:03:29,480
específico de prácticas de 
 
0:03:29.480 --> 0:03:32,330
sus acciones sus habilidades que operan a

0:03:32.330 --> 0:03:35,060
nivel individual de la empresa y el

0:03:35.060 --> 0:03:36,830
nivel social

0:03:36.830 --> 0:03:39,319
Ok así que quiero ser capaz de compartir parte de

0:03:39.319 --> 0:03:41,300
ese conocimiento con ustedes hoy porque

0:03:41.300 --> 0:03:42,920
cuando se sube a una montaña

0:03:42.920 --> 0:03:46,100
obviamente necesita tener el equipo adecuado 

0:03:46.100 --> 0:03:49,819
y también las habilidades adecuadas, muchos

0:03:49.819 --> 0:03:52,489
países por el camino están tratando de encontrar

0:03:52.489 --> 0:03:55,519
la alta escala de la innovación. Yo creo

0:03:55.519 --> 0:03:57,230
que hay probablemente al menos 50 países

0:03:57.230 --> 0:04:00,290
que tienen algún tipo de jefe nacional de innovación,

0:04:00.290 --> 0:04:03,080
una agencia de innovación y 

0:04:03.080 --> 0:04:06,620
una estrategia nacional de innovación en

0:04:06.620 --> 0:04:08,209
nuestros colegas y que estan haciendo un gran 

0:04:08.209 --> 0:04:11,030
 de documentación y lo que está sucediendo en 

0:04:11.030 --> 0:04:13,310
todo el mundo. Este es un 

0:04:13.310 --> 0:04:15,799
movimiento global por lo que muchos países se dedican

0:04:15.799 --> 0:04:17,720
a la noción de encontrar esta alta escala 

0:04:17.720,0:04:20.600
 y estoy tan feliz de que el Perú está ahora

0:04:20.600,0:04:23.660
comprometido en este viaje de búsqueda

0:04:23.660,0:04:27.979
 de la alta base de la innovación

0:04:27.979,0:04:36.160
Como mi computadora esta dormida

0:04:36.160,0:04:44.390
No es que

0:04:44.390,0:04:46.340
tenemos una montaña, pero queremos ver 

0:04:46.340,0:04:50.390
la siguiente diapositiva Creo que por lo que parece estar

0:04:50.390,0:04:54.530
congelado para entender lo que está pasando, usted

0:04:54.530,0:05:02.460
sabe

0:05:02.460,0:05:04.620
oh bien esto es la pesadilla de altavoz pero

0:05:04.620,0:05:06.990
voy a estar feliz de compartir con usted

0:05:06.990,0:05:08.490
el conocimiento de todos modos si tenemos

0:05:08.490,0:05:10.979
las fotos bonitas no son tan realmente lo que quiero 

0:05:10.979,0:05:13.319
hacer es centrarnos en tres básicas

0:05:13.319,0:05:15.240
preguntas. Si hay algo que puedo hacer

0:05:15.240,0:05:17.910
para ustedes que sea útil hoy. Yo quiero

0:05:17.910,0:05:26.370
de llegar a tres preguntas básicas

0:05:26.370,0:05:27.389
Bueno

0:05:27.389,0:05:30.210
estamos en el negocio. Tres preguntas básicas

0:05:30.210,0:05:32.130
¿Qué es la innovación?  

0:05:32.130,0:05:45.289
¿Por qué es importante?

0:05:45.289,0:05:49.099
Y ¿Cómo lo haces? Bien, yo creo que

0:05:49.099,0:05:50.659
la primera pregunta es importante porque

0:05:50.659,0:05:53.779
de una manera la innovación es la palabra más usada

0:05:53.779,0:05:56.629
y menos entendida palabra así sea  

0:05:56.629,0:05:58.520
en Inglés o en Español o en cualquier otro

0:05:58.520,0:06:01.430
lenguaje y creo que hay mucha

0:06:01.430,0:06:04.279
mucha discusión sobre lo que es.

0:06:04.279,0:06:06.979
Quiero intentar en primer lugar ser claro

0:06:06.979,0:06:10.639
acerca de ese tema, así que supongo que una de las

0:06:10.639,0:06:14.029
preguntas que quiero preguntarle primero

0:06:14.029,0:06:17.360
es qué te imaginas

0:06:17.360,0:06:19.129
supongo que lo estás viendo aquí

0:06:19.129,0:06:23.059
ya todo el punto. Si usted busca en google 

0:06:23.059,0:06:24.680
la palabra "Innovación", usted buscará

0:06:24.680,0:06:26.240
los resultados de los últimos 12 meses y usted observará

0:06:26.240,0:06:28.159
que la palabra "Innovación"

0:06:28.159,0:06:33.199
ha sido buscado en google 2.65 billones de veces. Esas son

0:06:33.199,0:06:34.520
buenas noticias y malas noticias. Las buenas 

0:06:34.520,0:06:36.830
noticias es que mucha gente esta hablando de eso.

0:06:36.830,0:06:38.479
Las malas noticias es que la palabra es usada es

0:06:38.479,0:06:41.389
tan utilizada a menudo que no tiene sentido por lo que

0:06:41.389,0:06:43.610
el primer desafio con relación a las

0:06:43.610,0:06:45.770
tres preguntas es ¿Cómo crear

0:06:45.770,0:06:48.139
la alineación entre las personas de gobierno,

0:06:48.139,0:06:50.779
sector privado, personas académicas, 

0:06:50.779,0:06:53.209
politicos no son inocentes 

0:06:53.209,0:06:56.419
hablando el mismo idioma en términos de lo que es lo que

0:06:56.419,0:07:00.289
mporta mucho lo que el mapa

0:07:00.289,0:07:02.269
es que utiliza para hablar acerca de 

0:07:02.269,0:07:05.269
lo que se debe de saber sobre innovación

0:07:05.269,0:07:09.499
lo que está pasando aquí la noción de un mapa 

0:07:09.499,0:07:11.180
se ilustra en esta diapositiva 

0:07:11.180,0:07:14.689
el mpa de marinero del siglo XVII

0:07:14.689,0:07:17.539
que mestra a California como una

0:07:17.539,0:07:19.490
isla frente a la costa de Norteamérica.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0:07:19.490,0:07:21.409
Esto no es un mapa real. Mucha gente piensa que

0:07:21.409,0:07:24.169
California es realmente una isla frente

0:07:24.169,0:07:26.599
a la costa de Norteamérica. Pero su discurso al

0:07:26.599,0:07:28.699
poder de sus modelos mentales por lo que estos

0:07:28.699,0:07:30.800
en estos días hay muchos

0:07:30.800,0:07:34.519
y diferentes sabores de la innovación. Voy a hacer 

0:07:34.519,0:07:41.119
es abandonar mi puerto USB y sólo hacerlo

0:07:41.119,0:07:43.129
de esta manera bien. Por lo que tenemos la innovación

0:07:43.129,0:07:45.080
inversa que es el flujo de la

0:07:45.080,0:07:46.909
innovación para el desarollo de los países

0:07:46.909,0:07:49.339
desarrollados nosotros tenemos una innovación a código abierto

0:07:49.339,0:07:51.919
innovación a larga escala, que es un término

0:07:51.919,0:07:54.680
que yo he inventando para hablar acerca de la innovación

0:07:54.680,0:07:57.700
En un nivel social centrado en el usuario

0:07:57.700,0:07:59.920
la innovación se trata 

0:07:59.920,0:08:02.260
de la unión de los principios de diseño

0:08:02.260,0:08:05.380
con la economía de una sociedad dada.

0:08:05.380,0:08:08.320
La innovación digital un tema muy grande cómo

0:08:08.320,0:08:10.720
las redes sociales empiezan a afectar

0:08:10.720,0:08:13.330
la capacidad de todos nosotros para contribuir

0:08:13.330,0:08:15.430
a un movimiento de innovación dentro de una

0:08:15.430,0:08:18.460
sociedad innovación indígena que es el

0:08:18.460,0:08:21.670
enfoque de China para la construcción

0:08:21.670,0:08:24.340
de una capital intelectual en su 

0:08:24.340,0:08:27.610
su gran país como impulsor

0:08:27.610,0:08:29.170
de la economía Y el desarrollo social 

0:08:29.170,0:08:31.930
de China que usted puede saber ha anunciado que

0:08:31.930,0:08:34.900
han gastado 1.5 trillones de dólares

0:08:34.900,0:08:38.140
en toda una serie de nuevos horizontes 

0:08:38.140,0:08:40.810
de la tecnología científica

0:08:40.810,0:08:43.419
y las áreas relacionadas con la innovación y, finalmente, 

0:08:43.419,0:08:45.190
hay toda la noción de la innovación de la sostenibilidad

0:08:45.190,0:08:48.670
Nike una empresa muy conocida

0:08:48.670,0:08:52.120
ha fusionado esencialmente su 

0:08:52.120,0:08:54.190
equipo de innovación con su

0:08:54.190,0:08:56.410
equipo de sostenibilidad porque no ven 

0:08:56.410,0:08:58.810
difference between the two so I think

0:08:58.810,0:09:00.640
you can see here the richness of

0:09:00.640,0:09:02.980
innovation but also the challenge

0:09:02.980,0:09:04.720
because the word means many different

0:09:04.720,0:09:08.500
things too many different people so let

0:09:08.500,0:09:10.330
me try to just give you some simple

0:09:10.330,0:09:23.320
definitions what's going on

0:09:23.320,0:09:25.390
it feels like there's some something is

0:09:25.390,0:09:27.400
signaling this thing and it's just

0:09:27.400,0:09:31.870
telling it to keep going or you know

0:09:31.870,0:09:33.220
let's just put it on the regular

0:09:33.220,0:09:43.080
presentation mode i'll take it off

0:09:43.080,0:09:46.680
ok so just just go over here ok right

0:09:46.680,0:09:55.670
like here

0:09:55.670,0:09:56.750
ok

0:09:56.750,0:10:03.200
so maybe this is gonna be better

0:10:03.200,0:10:05.780
ok so creativity and innovation or not

0:10:05.780,0:10:08.360
the same thing we're improvising now so

0:10:08.360,0:10:09.830
thank you for being patient

0:10:09.830,0:10:11.930
creativity is our human ability to

0:10:11.930,0:10:15.050
generate new ideas we cannot help it

0:10:15.050,0:10:17.570
we sleep at night we get new ideas we

0:10:17.570,0:10:19.760
are in a meeting sometimes we daydream

0:10:19.760,0:10:21.920
our brains are engineered to come up

0:10:21.920,0:10:24.050
with new ideas but it doesn't mean that

0:10:24.050,0:10:27.050
the new ideas have value so the basic

0:10:27.050,0:10:29.750
definition of innovation which comes out

0:10:29.750,0:10:32.090
of the dictionary innovation is

0:10:32.090,0:10:36.170
creativity applied to some purpose to

0:10:36.170,0:10:39.830
generate value now I thought this was a

0:10:39.830,0:10:42.650
pretty good definition until I started

0:10:42.650,0:10:45.020
working with countries and looking at

0:10:45.020,0:10:47.600
innovation as a societal issue because

0:10:47.600,0:10:50.480
frankly you know a country is not in the

0:10:50.480,0:10:53.450
business of just generating profits from

0:10:53.450,0:10:55.640
developing new products that can then

0:10:55.640,0:11:01.010
realize and increase in their stock

0:11:01.010,0:11:03.589
price and earnings per share from your

0:11:03.589,0:11:05.060
societies are in the business of

0:11:05.060,0:11:06.770
providing for the well-being of their

0:11:06.770,0:11:08.900
citizens societies are in the business

0:11:08.900,0:11:11.510
of pursuing the human adventure

0:11:11.510,0:11:14.420
moonshots so it matters a great deal

0:11:14.420,0:11:16.730
what the purpose of innovation is what

0:11:16.730,0:11:19.220
innovation is for and so my own

0:11:19.220,0:11:21.560
definition therefore is a little bit

0:11:21.560,0:11:23.240
different from the traditional one which

0:11:23.240,0:11:25.220
is that innovation is a set of

0:11:25.220,0:11:26.600
capabilities

0:11:26.600,0:11:29.810
it's a set of real skills that allow

0:11:29.810,0:11:33.740
what I would argue the continuous

0:11:33.740,0:11:37.190
realization of a future that you want a

0:11:37.190,0:11:40.310
desired future it's not just enough to

0:11:40.310,0:11:42.170
make new stuff that you can sell at a

0:11:42.170,0:11:45.530
profit that gives you variety but

0:11:45.530,0:11:47.480
societies i would argue are in the

0:11:47.480,0:11:50.330
business of making meaning of fulfilling

0:11:50.330,0:11:52.220
purpose and this applies to individuals

0:11:52.220,0:11:55.339
as well why would any of you get out of

0:11:55.339,0:11:57.530
bed early in the morning to pursue an

0:11:57.530,0:12:00.080
innovation agenda if it didn't relate to

0:12:00.080,0:12:02.510
some idea that you had about something

0:12:02.510,0:12:04.850
you wanted something that you dreamt of

0:12:04.850,0:12:07.820
and similarly the vision of a company we

0:12:07.820,0:12:10.019
all know is a powerful engine

0:12:10.019,0:12:12.629
and for driving innovation agendas and

0:12:12.629,0:12:15.600
so it should be with countries in my

0:12:15.600,0:12:17.129
experience countries that are

0:12:17.129,0:12:19.800
sophisticated at dealing with innovation

0:12:19.800,0:12:22.529
agendas have an answer to the question

0:12:22.529,0:12:26.339
what is the purpose of innovation in

0:12:26.339,0:12:28.980
your country and a purpose that goes

0:12:28.980,0:12:32.639
beyond the basics of providing for the

0:12:32.639,0:12:35.100
economic and social well-being of its

0:12:35.100,0:12:36.269
citizens

0:12:36.269,0:12:40.230
what is the purpose right so this is a

0:12:40.230,0:12:42.029
perhaps slightly different view on

0:12:42.029,0:12:43.739
innovation and similarly I believe

0:12:43.739,0:12:45.899
innovation is not just about new

0:12:45.899,0:12:48.959
products about new services new ways of

0:12:48.959,0:12:51.869
doing things new behaviors new ways of

0:12:51.869,0:12:53.999
seeing opportunity and it's not just

0:12:53.999,0:12:57.029
about science and technology science and

0:12:57.029,0:12:59.819
technology may be important arenas in a

0:12:59.819,0:13:02.610
society where new ideas are developed

0:13:02.610,0:13:05.249
that certain but innovation is about

0:13:05.249,0:13:07.920
taking those ideas from the laboratory

0:13:07.920,0:13:10.079
from the people wearing the white

0:13:10.079,0:13:14.549
laboratory codes into the marketplace at

0:13:14.549,0:13:18.059
Thomas Edison was not an innovator when

0:13:18.059,0:13:20.670
he developed the first light bulb

0:13:20.670,0:13:23.339
he was an adventurer and it was only

0:13:23.339,0:13:26.670
when the light bulb got sold in the

0:13:26.670,0:13:28.920
millions that you could really say he

0:13:28.920,0:13:31.529
was an innovator because he had changed

0:13:31.529,0:13:35.670
the existing order of things right so

0:13:35.670,0:13:37.319
there's something about innovation that

0:13:37.319,0:13:39.240
I think is bigger than science and

0:13:39.240,0:13:41.249
technology in the work that I've been

0:13:41.249,0:13:43.679
doing various countries it involves

0:13:43.679,0:13:46.529
cultural industries and involves design

0:13:46.529,0:13:49.740
it involves national mindset involves

0:13:49.740,0:13:53.339
many dimensions of a country's resources

0:13:53.339,0:13:56.490
that certainly includes science and

0:13:56.490,0:13:58.740
technology but cannot be just equated

0:13:58.740,0:14:01.049
with science and technology

0:14:01.049,0:14:03.179
I'm feeling better now about the slide

0:14:03.179,0:14:07.169
presentation so the innovation model

0:14:07.169,0:14:09.509
that a country adopt also very much

0:14:09.509,0:14:12.660
relate to its stage of you could say

0:14:12.660,0:14:16.110
innovation development and I think this

0:14:16.110,0:14:18.720
is an important point for peru to be

0:14:18.720,0:14:22.499
thinking about so 1.0 was innocence

0:14:22.499,0:14:25.409
the industrial era the era of mass

0:14:25.409,0:14:28.559
production economies of scale learning

0:14:28.559,0:14:31.919
curve effects right all of the many of

0:14:31.919,0:14:34.049
the great enterprises that we still

0:14:34.049,0:14:36.869
respect today come out of the industrial

0:14:36.869,0:14:41.849
era but 2.0 i would argue is the era of

0:14:41.849,0:14:44.039
you could say silicon valley it's the

0:14:44.039,0:14:46.739
era of venture capital it's the era of

0:14:46.739,0:14:49.289
disruptive innovation it's the era of

0:14:49.289,0:14:53.069
the killer app and this era is also very

0:14:53.069,0:14:54.989
much with us you know I live in San

0:14:54.989,0:14:56.999
Francisco I'm right next door to Silicon

0:14:56.999,0:14:59.099
Valley I see this every day it's very

0:14:59.099,0:15:01.379
much alive but I think where we are

0:15:01.379,0:15:04.319
heading in terms of the innovation field

0:15:04.319,0:15:07.229
overall if I can use that term is to a

0:15:07.229,0:15:10.889
3.0 innovation that's very much about

0:15:10.889,0:15:13.319
innovation at human scale so

0:15:13.319,0:15:15.869
human-centered innovation the whole

0:15:15.869,0:15:19.469
emergence of design and design thinking

0:15:19.469,0:15:23.489
and user experience is a pointer to the

0:15:23.489,0:15:26.309
importance of designing and innovating

0:15:26.309,0:15:29.099
not because you want to just create a

0:15:29.099,0:15:31.049
new technology but because you want to

0:15:31.049,0:15:33.059
create something that's relevant for

0:15:33.059,0:15:33.899
people

0:15:33.899,0:15:35.609
the revolution and social networking

0:15:35.609,0:15:38.039
ultimately is about people

0:15:38.039,0:15:39.989
the fact that Apple computer on a given

0:15:39.989,0:15:42.899
day might be then the most valuable

0:15:42.899,0:15:44.909
company in the United States is

0:15:44.909,0:15:47.699
primarily based on their understanding

0:15:47.699,0:15:50.549
of people of the user experience of what

0:15:50.549,0:15:52.769
happens it in the magic between the

0:15:52.769,0:15:55.409
connection of a person with their ipad

0:15:55.409,0:15:58.949
ipod macbook air and so forth and so on

0:15:58.949,0:16:02.759
alright so many countries are grappling

0:16:02.759,0:16:04.559
with how to be clear about where they

0:16:04.559,0:16:06.329
are in terms of the evolution of

0:16:06.329,0:16:09.539
thinking with regard to what stage what

0:16:09.539,0:16:12.269
model of innovation they're engaged with

0:16:12.269,0:16:15.689
it's also important because i would

0:16:15.689,0:16:17.819
argue that there's a new point of view

0:16:17.819,0:16:23.099
on Luna it's not perfect a new

0:16:23.099,0:16:24.689
definition of wealth

0:16:24.689,0:16:28.169
alright so in the old days wealth was

0:16:28.169,0:16:31.649
based on tangible assets things that you

0:16:31.649,0:16:34.919
could pull out of the ground copper for

0:16:34.919,0:16:36.180
instance or oil

0:16:36.180,0:16:39.360
depreciable assets money in the bank and

0:16:39.360,0:16:41.730
this is a view of economics that is

0:16:41.730,0:16:45.390
certain to continue but my hunch is that

0:16:45.390,0:16:47.670
we're going to be entering into an era

0:16:47.670,0:16:51.149
in which new definition of wealth will

0:16:51.149,0:16:53.700
become important and so the sum of the

0:16:53.700,0:16:56.310
creative ability the talent of an

0:16:56.310,0:16:59.190
organization or a society the appetite

0:16:59.190,0:17:01.980
for risk the ability to experiment that

0:17:01.980,0:17:05.309
enables the transformation of what is

0:17:05.309,0:17:08.429
possible into what is valuable

0:17:08.429,0:17:11.730
this may be the new wealth so measured

0:17:11.730,0:17:13.290
by those metrics there may be some

0:17:13.290,0:17:14.910
countries that we think of as being very

0:17:14.910,0:17:17.670
wealthy that in fact if we look at it

0:17:17.670,0:17:19.980
through innovation lens are becoming

0:17:19.980,0:17:21.839
less wealthy and conversely other

0:17:21.839,0:17:24.959
countries that may be relatively poorer

0:17:24.959,0:17:28.500
in the traditional asset class but are

0:17:28.500,0:17:31.740
able to leap frog into this new definite

0:17:31.740,0:17:34.500
mission of wealth that has to do with

0:17:34.500,0:17:37.260
building this kind of talent economy

0:17:37.260,0:17:39.450
these kind of capabilities for

0:17:39.450,0:17:41.400
innovation you know so how do you build

0:17:41.400,0:17:43.920
an innovation engine within a society

0:17:43.920,0:17:46.590
it's a very interesting question i wrote

0:17:46.590,0:17:49.290
a book called innovation nation which is

0:17:49.290,0:17:51.000
really looking at this whole notion of

0:17:51.000,0:17:54.059
how a whole country mobilizes around the

0:17:54.059,0:17:56.580
notion of being and an innovative

0:17:56.580,0:17:59.400
society and as i said earlier many

0:17:59.400,0:18:01.710
countries are grappling with how to do

0:18:01.710,0:18:05.370
that so innovations also complicated to

0:18:05.370,0:18:07.200
talk about because it operates at

0:18:07.200,0:18:14.670
multiple levels see jobs is a very

0:18:14.670,0:18:17.250
innovative individual capable of coming

0:18:17.250,0:18:21.720
up with new ideas so he at the same time

0:18:21.720,0:18:24.330
he worked with a talented set of teams

0:18:24.330,0:18:26.700
this is the Apple software development

0:18:26.700,0:18:29.760
team he has apple computer which is a

0:18:29.760,0:18:32.910
innovative company located in property

0:18:32.910,0:18:34.710
no California which is an innovative

0:18:34.710,0:18:37.920
society or part of a society so think

0:18:37.920,0:18:39.510
about it you have to be good at

0:18:39.510,0:18:44.550
psychology interpersonal behavior group

0:18:44.550,0:18:45.799
dynamics

0:18:45.799,0:18:48.559
organizational behavior leadership

0:18:48.559,0:18:52.129
theory macroeconomics social theory they

0:18:52.129,0:18:53.720
are all relevant for looking at

0:18:53.720,0:18:56.419
innovation so it's a big canvas of

0:18:56.419,0:18:59.659
disciplines and issues that are required

0:18:59.659,0:19:00.559
I guess what I'm trying to say

0:19:00.559,0:19:02.720
ultimately is that innovation is not a

0:19:02.720,0:19:05.749
simple topic now simply saying yes we

0:19:05.749,0:19:07.399
believe it's important we want more

0:19:07.399,0:19:10.940
doesn't necessarily get you more

0:19:10.940,0:19:13.580
what is really necessary is to look at

0:19:13.580,0:19:16.730
what the different aspects of innovation

0:19:16.730,0:19:18.859
are that represent opportunities to

0:19:18.859,0:19:21.230
build capabilities within a society

0:19:21.230,0:19:24.679
within a company and to design a

0:19:24.679,0:19:27.259
campaign or actually realizing that will

0:19:27.259,0:19:30.919
come back to that more subsequently ok

0:19:30.919,0:19:33.169
so one topic down two more to go

0:19:33.169,0:19:50.140
this thing is got a mind of its own

0:19:50.140,0:19:52.300
alright so the second question is why is

0:19:52.300,0:19:53.260
it important

0:19:53.260,0:19:57.280
this is I think also extremely essential

0:19:57.280,0:19:59.710
to recognize because it relates to what

0:19:59.710,0:20:01.780
i would call the second challenge which

0:20:01.780,0:20:04.090
is how do you create a sense of urgency

0:20:04.090,0:20:06.850
around innovation you know innovation is

0:20:06.850,0:20:09.340
not like spinach where it's good for you

0:20:09.340,0:20:10.750
and the more you eat the stronger you

0:20:10.750,0:20:13.900
will be i think innovation only comes

0:20:13.900,0:20:16.240
alive whether it's in your life or in

0:20:16.240,0:20:18.730
your company or in your country when you

0:20:18.730,0:20:21.910
have a sense of urgency that motivates

0:20:21.910,0:20:23.590
you to actually behave differently

0:20:23.590,0:20:25.240
because otherwise why would you behave

0:20:25.240,0:20:26.800
differently you wouldn't have to you

0:20:26.800,0:20:30.940
could just you could just basically a so

0:20:30.940,0:20:35.020
it's still doing this you tell me you

0:20:35.020,0:20:37.330
can just stay at home basically and do

0:20:37.330,0:20:39.400
the things that are you're familiar with

0:20:39.400,0:20:41.800
so i think this notion of creating a

0:20:41.800,0:20:43.690
sense of urgency is extremely important

0:20:43.690,0:20:45.580
as was said earlier we live in a period

0:20:45.580,0:20:48.070
of economic upheaval turbulence

0:20:48.070,0:20:50.380
traditional business models are being

0:20:50.380,0:20:51.880
stood on their head

0:20:51.880,0:20:55.750
so this whole notion of creating a sense

0:20:55.750,0:20:58.210
of urgency within a organizational

0:20:58.210,0:21:01.480
culture but also within a national

0:21:01.480,0:21:04.000
social environment is I think extremely

0:21:04.000,0:21:07.900
important as an agenda item and this

0:21:07.900,0:21:10.750
relates to the question of how ok so i

0:21:10.750,0:21:12.790
guess we're going to move on to the

0:21:12.790,0:21:15.580
third topic which is how do you do

0:21:15.580,0:21:19.090
innovation this is actually what I most

0:21:19.090,0:21:24.370
enjoy talking about because most of the

0:21:24.370,0:21:27.610
other dimensions of an innovation

0:21:27.610,0:21:29.350
initiative are kind of like the hand

0:21:29.350,0:21:31.750
waving well let's understand what it is

0:21:31.750,0:21:33.940
let's understand that it's important but

0:21:33.940,0:21:36.310
the real work comes about when you

0:21:36.310,0:21:38.590
address the issue of how to do it

0:21:38.590,0:21:40.210
what do you actually do if you're a

0:21:40.210,0:21:42.100
small group of leaders and you're in a

0:21:42.100,0:21:44.170
conference room and you're doing the

0:21:44.170,0:21:45.610
work of innovation

0:21:45.610,0:21:47.170
what are the activities that that

0:21:47.170,0:21:51.100
actually entails if you're the head of a

0:21:51.100,0:21:54.070
government-led initiative on innovation

0:21:54.070,0:21:56.260
and you get a call from someone and they

0:21:56.260,0:21:58.900
say congratulations you're now in charge

0:21:58.900,0:22:01.850
of innovation for your country

0:22:01.850,0:22:04.130
what what do you do you know if you're

0:22:04.130,0:22:05.960
the chief innovation officer of your

0:22:05.960,0:22:08.270
company which is in a traditional

0:22:08.270,0:22:10.730
extractive industry and is trying to

0:22:10.730,0:22:13.610
reposition itself with new methods are

0:22:13.610,0:22:15.830
trying to diversify ER trying to think

0:22:15.830,0:22:18.350
differently about globalization what do

0:22:18.350,0:22:19.340
you do

0:22:19.340,0:22:21.770
right so innovation comes alive as a

0:22:21.770,0:22:25.100
practice not as a bumper sticker or

0:22:25.100,0:22:28.850
slogan you know it's as if I play music

0:22:28.850,0:22:32.720
a lot and I thought a lot about how jazz

0:22:32.720,0:22:34.850
music in particular relates to the

0:22:34.850,0:22:36.919
innovation process and you know for a

0:22:36.919,0:22:39.409
lot of people innovation would be as if

0:22:39.409,0:22:42.590
I said to this gentleman over here we're

0:22:42.590,0:22:44.720
gonna have a surprise for you you're

0:22:44.720,0:22:47.390
going to give it a jazz concert tomorrow

0:22:47.390,0:22:50.179
but don't worry because i'm going to

0:22:50.179,0:22:53.270
encourage you and i'm going to give you

0:22:53.270,0:22:57.559
the the the powerpoint presentation so

0:22:57.559,0:23:00.380
you'll understand how to do it and you

0:23:00.380,0:23:02.750
know i will all kind of make sure that

0:23:02.750,0:23:05.870
you feel motivated to do it and of

0:23:05.870,0:23:08.419
course unless you had practice for about

0:23:08.419,0:23:11.630
10 years scales and basic skills you

0:23:11.630,0:23:13.280
wouldn't be able to do it and I believe

0:23:13.280,0:23:14.870
firmly that it's the same thing with

0:23:14.870,0:23:17.090
innovation innovation doesn't come about

0:23:17.090,0:23:19.370
just because you say it is important it

0:23:19.370,0:23:21.919
comes about because individuals teams

0:23:21.919,0:23:26.900
companies societies practice it and

0:23:26.900,0:23:29.690
practicing it is the hard part and

0:23:29.690,0:23:31.789
that's what I think we're here to to

0:23:31.789,0:23:33.020
talk about so it's kind of like the

0:23:33.020,0:23:34.130
third challenge

0:23:34.130,0:23:35.840
how do you move from understanding

0:23:35.840,0:23:38.030
innovation from getting it to getting it

0:23:38.030,0:23:39.950
done and the short answer is it's

0:23:39.950,0:23:41.059
complicated

0:23:41.059,0:23:43.370
there are many moving parts to an

0:23:43.370,0:23:46.220
innovation system within an organization

0:23:46.220,0:23:47.750
or within a society there are many

0:23:47.750,0:23:50.720
components so it's complex you know and

0:23:50.720,0:23:51.830
i'm not going to go into all of these

0:23:51.830,0:23:53.690
because every one of these topics is

0:23:53.690,0:23:56.510
this is a talk unto itself but you know

0:23:56.510,0:24:00.500
just to to review a few of them what is

0:24:00.500,0:24:04.610
the vision that drives the purpose of

0:24:04.610,0:24:05.570
innovation

0:24:05.570,0:24:08.840
how do you establish the sense of

0:24:08.840,0:24:09.980
urgency

0:24:09.980,0:24:12.230
what is the role of leadership in

0:24:12.230,0:24:14.230
articulating the vision

0:24:14.230,0:24:17.020
how do you create a narrative a story

0:24:17.020,0:24:20.440
that makes people motivated to change

0:24:20.440,0:24:22.900
their behavior how do you shift the

0:24:22.900,0:24:25.179
culture of a government or an

0:24:25.179,0:24:27.820
organization to more risk-taking two

0:24:27.820,0:24:30.220
more experimentation to tolerance of

0:24:30.220,0:24:32.799
failure all of which are essential

0:24:32.799,0:24:34.960
ingredients that the innovation process

0:24:34.960,0:24:38.350
you all did not ride a bicycle correctly

0:24:38.350,0:24:41.140
the first time you had a bicycle i'm

0:24:41.140,0:24:42.940
sure most of you fell down and if you're

0:24:42.940,0:24:45.100
like me you probably fell down a lot

0:24:45.100,0:24:47.860
well so the learning process involves

0:24:47.860,0:24:50.799
failure risk experimentation

0:24:50.799,0:24:53.230
it's the same thing with innovation but

0:24:53.230,0:24:55.690
how much of the risk-taking and

0:24:55.690,0:24:57.790
experimentation and failure are

0:24:57.790,0:24:59.950
permitted in an organizational

0:24:59.950,0:25:01.780
environment or in a public sector

0:25:01.780,0:25:04.000
environment with all the accountability

0:25:04.000,0:25:05.169
that's involved

0:25:05.169,0:25:07.480
what is the strategy process by which

0:25:07.480,0:25:10.390
innovation comes alive within a company

0:25:10.390,0:25:14.080
or a society what kind of facilitation

0:25:14.080,0:25:17.110
or process knowledge is necessary to

0:25:17.110,0:25:19.330
help people work together more

0:25:19.330,0:25:20.650
effectively

0:25:20.650,0:25:22.480
where is the work of game-changing

0:25:22.480,0:25:25.929
innovation happen if it's likely that it

0:25:25.929,0:25:28.870
will be killed if it lives within the

0:25:28.870,0:25:31.030
mainstream organization

0:25:31.030,0:25:32.620
what is the role of information

0:25:32.620,0:25:35.169
technology in raising the level of

0:25:35.169,0:25:38.679
collaboration around innovation what is

0:25:38.679,0:25:42.309
the role of the customer user experience

0:25:42.309,0:25:45.460
user-centered design how do you make

0:25:45.460,0:25:48.460
investments that have a different risk

0:25:48.460,0:25:50.890
profile from your typical corporate

0:25:50.890,0:25:53.230
financial models or your typical

0:25:53.230,0:25:55.840
government investment models

0:25:55.840,0:25:57.700
how do you train people for the right

0:25:57.700,0:25:59.950
kinds of skills as you can see it's

0:25:59.950,0:26:02.530
complex there are many moving parts and

0:26:02.530,0:26:04.570
I think the headline that I want to

0:26:04.570,0:26:07.990
share with you this may be disappointing

0:26:07.990,0:26:12.850
there is no manual that I could give you

0:26:12.850,0:26:15.010
that would answer all the questions

0:26:15.010,0:26:18.549
about what Peru should do right there's

0:26:18.549,0:26:20.110
no three-ring binder with all the

0:26:20.110,0:26:22.450
answers when i say okay I turned to pee

0:26:22.450,0:26:25.120
for peru I look okay this is what you

0:26:25.120,0:26:26.870
should do instead

0:26:26.870,0:26:29.750
you are on a journey the journey is one

0:26:29.750,0:26:32.510
of designing the future that you want

0:26:32.510,0:26:35.120
designing the innovation system that you

0:26:35.120,0:26:37.550
want with all of the uncertainty that is

0:26:37.550,0:26:39.890
involved i could make a case not being

0:26:39.890,0:26:41.660
an expert by any means on what's going

0:26:41.660,0:26:46.250
on here that the treasure for you is not

0:26:46.250,0:26:49.430
so much in incremental improving what

0:26:49.430,0:26:50.540
you have

0:26:50.540,0:26:52.850
that's very important but actually

0:26:52.850,0:26:55.520
figuring out how to leapfrog from where

0:26:55.520,0:26:58.820
you are to where you could be in

0:26:58.820,0:27:01.429
selected areas and applying your

0:27:01.429,0:27:05.090
resources to developing a portfolio of

0:27:05.090,0:27:07.280
innovation initiatives at a national

0:27:07.280,0:27:10.820
level that will enable you to both take

0:27:10.820,0:27:13.790
care of improvement of existing

0:27:13.790,0:27:16.400
businesses but also to have one or two

0:27:16.400,0:27:19.850
moonshots you know opportunities that

0:27:19.850,0:27:21.710
are unproven but that might create

0:27:21.710,0:27:24.260
public excitement engagement and

0:27:24.260,0:27:25.940
ultimately create a tremendous amount of

0:27:25.940,0:27:30.980
value for your country countries out

0:27:30.980,0:27:33.260
there that are smart about innovation in

0:27:33.260,0:27:35.390
my opinion have a strategy and the

0:27:35.390,0:27:38.630
strategy is no more or less than this we

0:27:38.630,0:27:41.510
have finite resources we can only do a

0:27:41.510,0:27:43.700
few things we want to do them really

0:27:43.700,0:27:46.190
well we want to understand what's going

0:27:46.190,0:27:48.710
on in the global environment so we fit

0:27:48.710,0:27:51.020
into the value chain for innovation

0:27:51.020,0:27:55.640
globally so let's um then do a strategy

0:27:55.640,0:27:58.160
process and make some decisions right

0:27:58.160,0:27:59.840
you know

0:27:59.840,0:28:01.790
thailand for instance has a national

0:28:01.790,0:28:05.420
innovation agency it has a building it

0:28:05.420,0:28:08.120
has a staff it has a director of

0:28:08.120,0:28:10.160
national innovation they have three

0:28:10.160,0:28:13.640
priorities agricultural and food related

0:28:13.640,0:28:17.300
innovation life sciences and innovation

0:28:17.300,0:28:19.280
in the area of culture and cultural

0:28:19.280,0:28:21.500
artifacts that's their national strategy

0:28:21.500,0:28:23.570
and it's based on a sense of national

0:28:23.570,0:28:24.350
purpose

0:28:24.350,0:28:26.900
well I mean that could inspire some

0:28:26.900,0:28:28.460
thinking here because I know that those

0:28:28.460,0:28:30.290
are areas of strength for Peru as well

0:28:30.290,0:28:33.920
you know so this there is no country out

0:28:33.920,0:28:35.960
there that's the textbook and there is

0:28:35.960,0:28:38.060
no three-ring binder but there is an

0:28:38.060,0:28:40.320
exciting set of opportunities

0:28:40.320,0:28:43.259
for all of you in this area so this is

0:28:43.259,0:28:46.500
the point what are the questions that

0:28:46.500,0:28:53.130
are that are required for peru to be

0:28:53.130,0:28:55.740
very successful in the innovation area

0:28:55.740,0:28:59.970
well clearly one is to decide on a

0:28:59.970,0:29:03.240
vision of the desired future that

0:29:03.240,0:29:05.460
defines the purpose and direction for

0:29:05.460,0:29:08.549
innovation efforts today and that i

0:29:08.549,0:29:10.950
would argue also creates a global

0:29:10.950,0:29:15.179
context for the innovation efforts that

0:29:15.179,0:29:17.190
you do if there are 50 countries out

0:29:17.190,0:29:21.570
there already doing innovation and if

0:29:21.570,0:29:23.700
there is competition in the innovation

0:29:23.700,0:29:28.919
area where can proof it into the value

0:29:28.919,0:29:31.289
chains out there this this

0:29:31.289,0:29:33.360
transformation of innovation as a global

0:29:33.360,0:29:34.769
phenomenon is one of the most

0:29:34.769,0:29:37.080
significant economic and social

0:29:37.080,0:29:40.169
development of the early 21st century

0:29:40.169,0:29:42.419
you know it for example it used to be

0:29:42.419,0:29:45.990
that a pharmaceutical company was a big

0:29:45.990,0:29:51.090
monolithic company in Basel Switzerland

0:29:51.090,0:29:54.179
or New Jersey it had a wall around it it

0:29:54.179,0:29:56.129
had employees that were signed up with

0:29:56.129,0:29:58.710
contracts you have to use a key to get

0:29:58.710,0:30:01.830
into the laboratory and everything was

0:30:01.830,0:30:03.840
vertically integrated from the people in

0:30:03.840,0:30:06.090
the white lab coats to the people who

0:30:06.090,0:30:08.340
were selling you the drugs in the

0:30:08.340,0:30:09.990
doctor's office and giving you the free

0:30:09.990,0:30:14.190
pencils today the pharmaceutical

0:30:14.190,0:30:15.600
industry is a globally distributed

0:30:15.600,0:30:19.799
affair where the elements of innovation

0:30:19.799,0:30:21.870
are spread among many countries so for

0:30:21.870,0:30:24.149
example I I know a number of

0:30:24.149,0:30:27.570
pharmaceutical companies in San

0:30:27.570,0:30:30.509
Francisco that don't have 10,000 people

0:30:30.509,0:30:33.870
or a hundred people or a thousand but

0:30:33.870,0:30:36.720
have five or ten people and everything

0:30:36.720,0:30:38.159
that you would identify as being

0:30:38.159,0:30:41.309
innovation oriented is in sourced from

0:30:41.309,0:30:43.830
another country clinical trials are done

0:30:43.830,0:30:46.169
in Poland medicinal chemistry is done in

0:30:46.169,0:30:49.950
India various kinds of various elements

0:30:49.950,0:30:52.470
of the innovation value chain

0:30:52.470,0:30:54.840
in the pharmaceutical industry are done

0:30:54.840,0:30:57.690
worldwide in different locations so that

0:30:57.690,0:31:00.929
means that smart countries understand

0:31:00.929,0:31:03.090
that in the areas they choose to compete

0:31:03.090,0:31:05.070
in they will want to be strong and

0:31:05.070,0:31:08.220
certain facets of the value chain right

0:31:08.220,0:31:10.409
because it's a new ballgame globally

0:31:10.409,0:31:13.320
distributed and that may be doing things

0:31:13.320,0:31:15.870
be of the same pattern that has existed

0:31:15.870,0:31:19.409
historically is not really the pathway

0:31:19.409,0:31:22.799
to a tremendous amount of value creation

0:31:22.799,0:31:25.530
not only in economic terms but in social

0:31:25.530,0:31:28.289
terms for your country

0:31:28.289,0:31:30.929
another important question is do you

0:31:30.929,0:31:34.650
have a way for disruptive innovation to

0:31:34.650,0:31:37.080
coexist with the day-to-day and this is

0:31:37.080,0:31:39.360
a fundamental challenge both in

0:31:39.360,0:31:41.760
companies and in countries what i mean

0:31:41.760,0:31:43.380
by disruptive is game-changing

0:31:43.380,0:31:46.860
innovation that you can't really prove

0:31:46.860,0:31:49.799
is going to work out that is disruptive

0:31:49.799,0:31:52.799
of the status quo and the reason that

0:31:52.799,0:31:54.840
there's little skunk here is because one

0:31:54.840,0:31:56.490
of the models for dealing with

0:31:56.490,0:31:58.980
disruptive innovation historically has

0:31:58.980,0:32:01.350
been the skunkworks which was invented

0:32:01.350,0:32:05.429
by the Lockheed corporation to put the

0:32:05.429,0:32:07.860
development of visionary different kinds

0:32:07.860,0:32:10.260
of airplanes into a completely separate

0:32:10.260,0:32:12.870
organization that was physically

0:32:12.870,0:32:15.090
separated and culturally separated you

0:32:15.090,0:32:17.309
know an apple developed the Macintosh

0:32:17.309,0:32:19.260
they moved all of the engineers out of

0:32:19.260,0:32:20.909
headquarters and into a separate

0:32:20.909,0:32:23.460
building there are many many examples of

0:32:23.460,0:32:26.669
making skunkworks we're even government

0:32:26.669,0:32:28.740
you know BR / for instance the United

0:32:28.740,0:32:30.990
States is a stunk works for energy

0:32:30.990,0:32:33.330
oriented innovation because it's a

0:32:33.330,0:32:36.600
truism that the today organization will

0:32:36.600,0:32:39.000
inevitably try to compete with or even

0:32:39.000,0:32:41.760
killed the tomorrow organization or if

0:32:41.760,0:32:44.640
the tomorrow organization is the 11th

0:32:44.640,0:32:48.000
priority in a 10-item list then you're

0:32:48.000,0:32:50.070
going to have a lot of trouble

0:32:50.070,0:32:51.720
convincing people to focus on the new

0:32:51.720,0:32:54.179
thing as opposed to the existing agenda

0:32:54.179,0:32:58.049
so how you as a country choose to

0:32:58.049,0:33:00.659
instantiate disruptive innovation you

0:33:00.659,0:33:02.909
know i would argue there's a white space

0:33:02.909,0:33:04.509
opportunity for peru

0:33:04.509,0:33:07.059
moonshot about which there's probably no

0:33:07.059,0:33:09.729
consensus today but which is probably

0:33:09.729,0:33:12.309
going to contribute mightily to value

0:33:12.309,0:33:14.619
creation and social development from now

0:33:14.619,0:33:15.969
to the middle of the century I don't

0:33:15.969,0:33:18.159
know what it is yet but it's part of

0:33:18.159,0:33:19.959
your innovation portfolio

0:33:19.959,0:33:21.699
how are you going to figure that out

0:33:21.699,0:33:22.929
well that's another interesting question

0:33:22.929,0:33:25.449
you know what is your process for

0:33:25.449,0:33:29.109
clarifying weak signals you know

0:33:29.109,0:33:32.679
possibilities emergent opportunities

0:33:32.679,0:33:35.889
this gentleman here you can probably see

0:33:35.889,0:33:38.319
a man's got headphones down there is

0:33:38.319,0:33:40.539
listening for something and if this is a

0:33:40.539,0:33:43.989
real picture he's listening for this

0:33:43.989,0:33:47.199
equally antique you know but this is the

0:33:47.199,0:33:48.909
distant early warning system which is

0:33:48.909,0:33:52.569
big ear cups into one person's ear so my

0:33:52.569,0:33:55.629
question for all of you is how do you

0:33:55.629,0:33:58.029
develop big ears for peru how do you

0:33:58.029,0:34:00.369
develop the kind of big ears that allow

0:34:00.369,0:34:02.859
you to understand emerging agendas and

0:34:02.859,0:34:06.669
not just in Peru or in Latin America but

0:34:06.669,0:34:10.179
on a global basis education i understand

0:34:10.179,0:34:13.569
is a big agenda going forward for peru

0:34:13.569,0:34:15.009
well if you go through the normal

0:34:15.009,0:34:17.589
development cycle of education and all

0:34:17.589,0:34:21.490
institutions that's one strategy

0:34:21.490,0:34:23.440
another is to understand that education

0:34:23.440,0:34:26.919
in certainly in first world countries is

0:34:26.919,0:34:29.440
about to undergo the same kind of

0:34:29.440,0:34:32.200
disruption that for instance the book

0:34:32.200,0:34:34.539
and music retailing industry went

0:34:34.539,0:34:36.250
through with the advent of the internet

0:34:36.250,0:34:41.019
so Napster and and block and virgin

0:34:41.019,0:34:45.549
megastore amazon and borders bookstore

0:34:45.549,0:34:47.470
no I mean that there's disruption of

0:34:47.470,0:34:49.179
playing field there will be similar

0:34:49.179,0:34:51.279
level of disruption in education

0:34:51.279,0:34:54.250
why shouldn't Peru jump on some of the

0:34:54.250,0:34:57.009
new models for distributed education

0:34:57.009,0:34:58.750
that involve technology and networking

0:34:58.750,0:35:00.759
and how would you go about doing that

0:35:00.759,0:35:04.180
we're with the big ears be placed within

0:35:04.180,0:35:06.039
peru to help you think about where those

0:35:06.039,0:35:07.690
opportunities were and then what would

0:35:07.690,0:35:10.630
be what would the the capabilities be

0:35:10.630,0:35:12.519
internally to start thinking about how

0:35:12.519,0:35:13.390
to do that

0:35:13.390,0:35:15.069
well these are I think the important

0:35:15.069,0:35:16.960
design questions that need to be

0:35:16.960,0:35:17.890
addressed

0:35:17.890,0:35:19.960
in terms of Peru's innovation agenda

0:35:19.960,0:35:22.690
then there's the whole question of who's

0:35:22.690,0:35:24.190
going to do the work

0:35:24.190,0:35:26.020
ok this is this is fundamentally

0:35:26.020,0:35:28.360
important as well I mean you have in a

0:35:28.360,0:35:31.420
given organization or society you know

0:35:31.420,0:35:33.400
just to make a big overgeneralization

0:35:33.400,0:35:35.200
three levels you know you've got the

0:35:35.200,0:35:37.540
senior person the head of state the CEO

0:35:37.540,0:35:40.210
and they've got to say it's important

0:35:40.210,0:35:43.030
and provide some support for this but

0:35:43.030,0:35:45.040
they're not going to do the work right

0:35:45.040,0:35:47.560
there going to enable the work then

0:35:47.560,0:35:49.270
you've got everyone in society you know

0:35:49.270,0:35:51.370
all of us the whole kind of you know

0:35:51.370,0:35:55.000
social networking phenomenon and ideas

0:35:55.000,0:35:56.530
are going to bubble up and they need to

0:35:56.530,0:35:58.600
bubble up and it needs to be possible

0:35:58.600,0:36:01.810
for them to bubble up but this the

0:36:01.810,0:36:04.750
entire citizen population of Peru is not

0:36:04.750,0:36:07.180
necessarily going to do the work either

0:36:07.180,0:36:09.640
so the question then becomes who's doing

0:36:09.640,0:36:11.890
the work and this is what I refer to as

0:36:11.890,0:36:14.800
the question of stewardship stewardship

0:36:14.800,0:36:16.150
meaning who's going to take

0:36:16.150,0:36:18.430
responsibility and this is very complex

0:36:18.430,0:36:21.370
because in every society you have public

0:36:21.370,0:36:23.500
sector you have national and regional

0:36:23.500,0:36:25.390
and local public sector you've got

0:36:25.390,0:36:28.180
private sector you've got NGOs you've

0:36:28.180,0:36:30.280
got universities you've got experts

0:36:30.280,0:36:32.950
you've got civil society and citizens

0:36:32.950,0:36:35.140
and somehow they've all got to come

0:36:35.140,0:36:37.630
together in a kind of collaborative

0:36:37.630,0:36:40.300
understanding around what innovation is

0:36:40.300,0:36:43.330
if it is to be a national issue as

0:36:43.330,0:36:45.460
opposed to just a program within

0:36:45.460,0:36:47.920
government with some innovation people

0:36:47.920,0:36:50.230
who are doing some innovation work and

0:36:50.230,0:36:52.480
that's important also but i think the

0:36:52.480,0:36:54.910
power really comes when this begins to

0:36:54.910,0:36:56.980
capture the public imagination and when

0:36:56.980,0:36:59.140
there are bridges of collaboration that

0:36:59.140,0:37:01.630
occur among the different players so the

0:37:01.630,0:37:03.640
middle level you can't quite see it

0:37:03.640,0:37:05.140
clearly but it's the coalition of

0:37:05.140,0:37:08.230
stakeholders is the big question for

0:37:08.230,0:37:10.840
spurred stewardship who is going to do

0:37:10.840,0:37:12.760
the work who is the multidisciplinary

0:37:12.760,0:37:16.330
team let's say that's the middleware of

0:37:16.330,0:37:18.310
the whole system that has certain

0:37:18.310,0:37:20.920
authorities and certain resources that

0:37:20.920,0:37:23.680
will be able to basically carry forward

0:37:23.680,0:37:25.120
and make this work

0:37:25.120,0:37:27.400
come alive make it happen so to speak so

0:37:27.400,0:37:29.890
every country has a different approach

0:37:29.890,0:37:31.000
to doing this

0:37:31.000,0:37:32.980
are successful some are less successful

0:37:32.980,0:37:35.110
this is I think currently a big

0:37:35.110,0:37:37.540
opportunity and also challenge for peru

0:37:37.540,0:37:39.640
who's going to do the work

0:37:39.640,0:37:41.920
you can't just be one designated you

0:37:41.920,0:37:44.110
know head innovation person because it

0:37:44.110,0:37:45.490
has to embrace all these different

0:37:45.490,0:37:47.560
sectors of society but then it begs a

0:37:47.560,0:37:48.760
lot of questions

0:37:48.760,0:37:51.910
well how often are going to need who's

0:37:51.910,0:37:54.340
in charge who calls people up to invite

0:37:54.340,0:37:55.390
them to come over

0:37:55.390,0:37:57.160
how long do they have a mandate for do

0:37:57.160,0:37:59.110
they have a budget you know what are the

0:37:59.110,0:38:01.210
expectations you know what can they say

0:38:01.210,0:38:02.950
publicly you know these kind of things

0:38:02.950,0:38:05.590
and it's exciting because you have a kit

0:38:05.590,0:38:07.720
you have a kit of possibilities to

0:38:07.720,0:38:10.390
create all of these pieces of an

0:38:10.390,0:38:12.130
innovation system and to make it come

0:38:12.130,0:38:14.230
alive but you have to make sure that

0:38:14.230,0:38:16.510
happens I've already talked about having

0:38:16.510,0:38:18.250
a sense of urgency and this involves

0:38:18.250,0:38:19.870
telling a story

0:38:19.870,0:38:22.000
what are the consequences for proof you

0:38:22.000,0:38:24.550
don't do it what's the upside if you do

0:38:24.550,0:38:27.010
you know exercising a little bit of the

0:38:27.010,0:38:29.800
Hollywood imagination then there's a

0:38:29.800,0:38:31.810
question of resources you know do have

0:38:31.810,0:38:34.630
the fuel needed to actually do the work

0:38:34.630,0:38:37.060
of innovation and it's not just money

0:38:37.060,0:38:40.900
it's also time its freedom right if you

0:38:40.900,0:38:43.540
want to do big things you've got to be

0:38:43.540,0:38:45.280
thinking about the resource question

0:38:45.280,0:38:47.410
which again means that you may need a

0:38:47.410,0:38:49.870
different approach to organizing and

0:38:49.870,0:38:51.610
distributing resources from a typical

0:38:51.610,0:38:54.940
capital allocation model that exists in

0:38:54.940,0:38:57.580
a government or in a company if you want

0:38:57.580,0:38:59.230
to get results mean one of the reasons

0:38:59.230,0:39:01.900
why silicon valley is so powerful as a

0:39:01.900,0:39:03.850
model is because there's such a high

0:39:03.850,0:39:06.070
level of trust that people are willing

0:39:06.070,0:39:09.130
to write big checks based on a handshape

0:39:09.130,0:39:11.140
and based on deep knowledge of the other

0:39:11.140,0:39:13.330
people you know this whole notion of how

0:39:13.330,0:39:16.270
you fund new things so they can take off

0:39:16.270,0:39:19.390
is a big challenge the early stage

0:39:19.390,0:39:23.800
venture capital model is essential but

0:39:23.800,0:39:25.150
then the question is how does it get

0:39:25.150,0:39:27.970
modified how does it come alive within a

0:39:27.970,0:39:30.070
Peruvian context you know if you don't

0:39:30.070,0:39:31.630
have the capital start new things

0:39:31.630,0:39:33.670
they're not going to start but then the

0:39:33.670,0:39:35.590
question is again back to the issue

0:39:35.590,0:39:37.750
culture what level of failure what level

0:39:37.750,0:39:39.580
of risk are you willing to tolerate so

0:39:39.580,0:39:43.130
on the most important

0:39:43.130,0:39:45.590
ingredient for a national innovation

0:39:45.590,0:39:47.930
agenda and i believe the most important

0:39:47.930,0:39:50.870
element of Peru as an innovation nation

0:39:50.870,0:39:53.690
will be finding an answer to this last

0:39:53.690,0:39:57.860
question which is can you find the

0:39:57.860,0:40:01.610
mental whitespace to take what existing

0:40:01.610,0:40:03.650
mental maps you might each have

0:40:03.650,0:40:06.260
individually and put them aside to try

0:40:06.260,0:40:09.110
to imagine what might be possible in

0:40:09.110,0:40:12.200
Peru so how do you get to what buddhists

0:40:12.200,0:40:15.140
call the beginner's mind or a mind that

0:40:15.140,0:40:18.560
is free of preconceptions because to be

0:40:18.560,0:40:20.600
able to go to that point is to be able

0:40:20.600,0:40:23.540
to start at the innovation process and

0:40:23.540,0:40:26.150
I'll just end my formal remarks we have

0:40:26.150,0:40:29.210
some time now for discussion and Q&A

0:40:29.210,0:40:33.290
here but you have a picture of a teacup

0:40:33.290,0:40:35.720
this is my favorite innovation story of

0:40:35.720,0:40:37.700
all it's a little bit of an odd one so

0:40:37.700,0:40:39.980
you'll have to follow me along but there

0:40:39.980,0:40:43.490
was a gentleman in ancient Japan who

0:40:43.490,0:40:46.550
wanted enlighten so we went to the local

0:40:46.550,0:40:49.640
temple and the priest there said you're

0:40:49.640,0:40:53.270
not ready come back in 10 years so this

0:40:53.270,0:40:55.310
gentleman was very embarrassed but

0:40:55.310,0:40:58.130
because he was very compliant 10 years

0:40:58.130,0:41:00.620
the day he came back and again the

0:41:00.620,0:41:03.380
preset you're not ready come back in 10

0:41:03.380,0:41:05.000
years so I'll make this very quick and

0:41:05.000,0:41:09.440
he is old he came back and this time the

0:41:09.440,0:41:12.350
preset you're ready come on in

0:41:12.350,0:41:14.900
what what took you so long and and our

0:41:14.900,0:41:16.970
our our hero can't believe is left so he

0:41:16.970,0:41:19.760
goes into this elegant little room and

0:41:19.760,0:41:21.710
the teacher says i have one instruction

0:41:21.710,0:41:27.200
for you hold out your teacup you go so

0:41:27.200,0:41:28.760
he holds out his teacup the teacher

0:41:28.760,0:41:32.000
pours tea into the cup the t fills up

0:41:32.000,0:41:35.900
the cup goes up up up to the edge spills

0:41:35.900,0:41:37.670
over the edge of the cup keeps pourin

0:41:37.670,0:41:39.800
mortise pills until finally there's a

0:41:39.800,0:41:44.810
huge liquid mess on the floor and in

0:41:44.810,0:41:47.900
that moment this gentleman achieves

0:41:47.900,0:41:52.440
enlightenment now you're not

0:41:52.440,0:41:54.240
opposed to interpret these stories and

0:41:54.240,0:41:56.550
you're supposed to meditate about him

0:41:56.550,0:42:00.390
for 20 years under a palm tree but you

0:42:00.390,0:42:02.099
know since we're in Peru and we're

0:42:02.099,0:42:04.710
postmodern and you're fast audience i'll

0:42:04.710,0:42:06.329
give you a little bit of interpretation

0:42:06.329,0:42:10.470
the cup in my view is our map it's our

0:42:10.470,0:42:12.300
point of view it's what we're able to

0:42:12.300,0:42:14.790
know inside the cup is all the knowledge

0:42:14.790,0:42:18.599
that we have and outside the cup is

0:42:18.599,0:42:21.119
everything else the knowledge that we

0:42:21.119,0:42:24.000
don't have and it's often the knowledge

0:42:24.000,0:42:27.750
that we don't have but would wish we had

0:42:27.750,0:42:31.560
had if we only knew what it was that is

0:42:31.560,0:42:35.280
the most valuable knowledge of all so

0:42:35.280,0:42:36.569
this pertains to the notion of

0:42:36.569,0:42:38.609
innovation experts about which I believe

0:42:38.609,0:42:41.310
there are few if any way any the

0:42:41.310,0:42:44.730
Buddhists say in the mind of the expert

0:42:44.730,0:42:48.510
there are many opinions in the mind of

0:42:48.510,0:42:53.160
the beginner there are few opinions and

0:42:53.160,0:42:57.630
therefore all new knowledge begins with

0:42:57.630,0:43:01.410
beginner's mind and so to be able to

0:43:01.410,0:43:03.240
take out that piece of white paper be

0:43:03.240,0:43:06.420
able to imagine a peru 10 20 50 years

0:43:06.420,0:43:09.869
from now with a innovation strategy

0:43:09.869,0:43:13.170
stewardship process culture of

0:43:13.170,0:43:14.819
innovation that is equal to the

0:43:14.819,0:43:17.130
phenomenal history the phenomenal assets

0:43:17.130,0:43:19.230
the phenomenal vitality of your society

0:43:19.230,0:43:23.640
in my view would be a dream come true so

0:43:23.640,0:43:25.349
I wish you a very good luck on that

0:43:25.349,0:43:26.970
journey and look forward to following

0:43:26.970,0:43:28.680
your great progress

0:43:28.680,0:43:35.540
thank you

0:43:51.680,0:43:54.710
I'm usually a very technology smooth guy

0:43:54.710,0:43:56.990
i must say so today's been a little bit

0:43:56.990,0:44:00.349
about a an outlier so please forgive me

0:44:00.349,0:44:03.500
for all of the technology issues but now

toda esta gente que estamos aqui tenemos

0:45:02.299,0:45:05.180
tiempo es diferente que estaba into

0:45:05.180,0:45:11.480
really started a transformer soon so i

0:45:11.480,0:45:13.849
think the role of the public sector in

0:45:13.849,0:45:16.579
innovation is extremely important and it

0:45:16.579,0:45:18.200
obviously will vary from country to

0:45:18.200,0:45:20.450
country it's only really in the united

0:45:20.450,0:45:21.859
states that we have these theological

0:45:21.859,0:45:23.809
debates about whether government should

0:45:23.809,0:45:26.119
have a rolling innovation or not because

0:45:26.119,0:45:27.829
you know if you're more on the right

0:45:27.829,0:45:29.510
wing of the spectrum you would say well

0:45:29.510,0:45:31.430
government shouldn't interfere

0:45:31.430,0:45:33.319
it's the invisible hand maybe you did

0:45:33.319,0:45:36.770
chicago school of economics at most of

0:45:36.770,0:45:38.630
us I think understand government sets

0:45:38.630,0:45:41.150
policy government create standards for

0:45:41.150,0:45:43.099
education government fun science

0:45:43.099,0:45:45.079
government does large public

0:45:45.079,0:45:47.000
infrastructure projects government has

0:45:47.000,0:45:50.270
procurement and government can do more

0:45:50.270,0:45:51.589
in terms of setting up innovation

0:45:51.589,0:45:53.720
agendas that have to do with science

0:45:53.720,0:45:56.329
with design culture etc the government

0:45:56.329,0:45:57.770
definitely has a roll the question is

0:45:57.770,0:45:58.510
what's the town

0:45:58.510,0:46:00.910
between government's role in the rest of

0:46:00.910,0:46:03.460
society failure modes would be a

0:46:03.460,0:46:05.170
government that says we know it all

0:46:05.170,0:46:07.510
we're going to do everything we have the

0:46:07.510,0:46:10.720
smart people in our ivory tower and then

0:46:10.720,0:46:12.700
they don't make use of all of the

0:46:12.700,0:46:15.070
creativity and knowledge in society

0:46:15.070,0:46:16.930
well that's not that's not really good

0:46:16.930,0:46:19.690
so finding again it's a stewardship

0:46:19.690,0:46:21.100
question the other question about

0:46:21.100,0:46:25.510
leadership is obviously you need

0:46:25.510,0:46:27.340
leadership leaders are the ones that

0:46:27.340,0:46:29.800
allow organizations and societies to

0:46:29.800,0:46:31.720
transform and take a leap into the

0:46:31.720,0:46:35.080
future right so basically a leader has

0:46:35.080,0:46:38.560
to give the people courage that there is

0:46:38.560,0:46:41.920
a good result at the end of something

0:46:41.920,0:46:45.490
new and has to be able to take risks and

0:46:45.490,0:46:49.300
authorized new initiatives and has to be

0:46:49.300,0:46:50.830
able to give people confidence that

0:46:50.830,0:46:53.200
their honor on a good path there as i

0:46:53.200,0:46:55.240
said earlier not going to do the work so

0:46:55.240,0:46:57.190
in Finland for instance the prime

0:46:57.190,0:47:00.970
minister of Finland in 1991's kaho was a

0:47:00.970,0:47:02.950
transformational leader for innovation

0:47:02.950,0:47:05.380
because when Finland's economy went like

0:47:05.380,0:47:07.630
that when the Soviet Union disappeared

0:47:07.630,0:47:09.460
is twenty-five percent of their foreign

0:47:09.460,0:47:12.700
trade disappeared like that escojo said

0:47:12.700,0:47:14.200
well we can't do everything finland

0:47:14.200,0:47:16.030
small we're going to succeed at three

0:47:16.030,0:47:19.960
things science education and innovation

0:47:19.960,0:47:22.330
so he was the innovation Prime Minister

0:47:22.330,0:47:26.020
no escojo no finland finnish you know

0:47:26.020,0:47:32.630
innovation agenda as we know it today

0:47:32.630,0:47:36.500
in Pictou system into completely Nostrum

0:47:36.500,0:47:38.780
procurement cemented the law

0:47:38.780,0:47:40.430

0:47:40.430,0:47:42.920
nothing being the empresa the center of

0:47:42.920,0:47:45.020

0:47:53.270,0:47:54.200
momento

0:47:54.200,0:47:56.510
so here is a lesson presence indian and

0:47:56.510,0:47:59.960
this person to see that in actually the

0:47:59.960,0:48:05.510
last you helping us to based so I think

0:48:05.510,0:48:08.240
that it's a great idea and the whole

0:48:08.240,0:48:10.460
idea that you have to reserve something

0:48:10.460,0:48:12.170
in your budget whether you're a

0:48:12.170,0:48:17.030
well-established company or country is a

0:48:17.030,0:48:18.740
really good idea and you know there's

0:48:18.740,0:48:21.050
certainly models of countries with large

0:48:21.050,0:48:23.240
amounts of natural resources and

0:48:23.240,0:48:25.280
extractive industries for a certain

0:48:25.280,0:48:28.070
percentage of that is required to go

0:48:28.070,0:48:30.530
into new areas i would not however

0:48:30.530,0:48:33.200
necessarily say it should be ten percent

0:48:33.200,0:48:35.780
or five percent or eight percent until I

0:48:35.780,0:48:38.780
had gotten much more specifically into a

0:48:38.780,0:48:41.390
country and its opportunities but the

0:48:41.390,0:48:44.660
idea of setting aside a national

0:48:44.660,0:48:48.440
innovation capital pool provided that

0:48:48.440,0:48:50.390
other smart things are done in terms of

0:48:50.390,0:48:53.060
getting smart people to manage it in

0:48:53.060,0:48:56.090
connection to a smart national strategy

0:48:56.090,0:49:00.410
is I think extremely important but not

this is not formally created to get

0:49:49.339,0:49:56.269
drunk of you so if I were providing an

0:49:56.269,0:49:58.249
opinion on this was like I am right now

0:49:58.249,0:50:01.880
i would say first of all you have to say

0:50:01.880,0:50:04.249
that education is a priority and that

0:50:04.249,0:50:06.109
transformation of education is a

0:50:06.109,0:50:08.150
priority and that connects to the

0:50:08.150,0:50:09.950
national innovation agenda so that

0:50:09.950,0:50:12.049
there's kind of a connection among these

0:50:12.049,0:50:13.729
different agendas and they're not just

0:50:13.729,0:50:16.489
little chunks within a a random

0:50:16.489,0:50:18.619
collection of of government and societal

0:50:18.619,0:50:22.190
agendas then i would use big ears

0:50:22.190,0:50:27.109
ok i would get up a commission of 15 or

0:50:27.109,0:50:29.569
20 of the top education technology

0:50:29.569,0:50:32.719
business innovation types to look at

0:50:32.719,0:50:35.180
education innovation models around the

0:50:35.180,0:50:37.849
world i would look at what's going on in

0:50:37.849,0:50:40.190
the united states with the marriage of

0:50:40.190,0:50:43.999
social networking and internet 3.0 on

0:50:43.999,0:50:46.069
the one hand and education at the other

0:50:46.069,0:50:48.920
i would look at the online education

0:50:48.920,0:50:50.690
models that are beginning to really

0:50:50.690,0:50:53.449
break out because it's not just about

0:50:53.449,0:50:55.910
putting content online and asking

0:50:55.910,0:50:57.949
questions but actually creating learning

0:50:57.949,0:50:59.690
communities where people linked together

0:50:59.690,0:51:01.549
and where the relationship between

0:51:01.549,0:51:03.619
students and teachers is utterly

0:51:03.619,0:51:06.170
transformed by new kind of social

0:51:06.170,0:51:10.009
platforms so what I am I'm not what so

0:51:10.009,0:51:11.479
what I'm saying is it's important to

0:51:11.479,0:51:14.029
take the existing system and improve it

0:51:14.029,0:51:15.380
there's no doubt that that has to be

0:51:15.380,0:51:18.109
done so more teachers a better

0:51:18.109,0:51:20.180
relationship with beat that the teachers

0:51:20.180,0:51:22.249
unions or whatever it might be more

0:51:22.249,0:51:24.410
infrastructure but I would also say that

0:51:24.410,0:51:26.449
there is a disruptive innovation play

0:51:26.449,0:51:29.539
which is the other track which is trying

0:51:29.539,0:51:31.339
to deeply understand what's going out

0:51:31.339,0:51:33.410
there and saying to yourselves

0:51:33.410,0:51:35.839
no country is an expert at

0:51:35.839,0:51:37.940
next-generation education using digital

0:51:37.940,0:51:39.199
technology

0:51:39.199,0:51:41.959
why couldn't Peru be in the front ranks

0:51:41.959,0:51:43.969
why couldn't Peru actually turn

0:51:43.969,0:51:45.380
ok so this is a very important point

0:51:45.380,0:51:48.890
reverse innovation refers to be the

0:51:48.890,0:51:50.869
ability of innovation to flow from

0:51:50.869,0:51:54.109
develop King to developed countries we

0:51:54.109,0:51:56.059
see this in healthcare for instance

0:51:56.059,0:51:57.040
GE has three

0:51:57.040,0:51:58.750
hundred health care product of projects

0:51:58.750,0:52:01.510
in rural India why this rule India's

0:52:01.510,0:52:03.970
really poor but it's rich in one thing

0:52:03.970,0:52:07.990
which is problem ownership seriously and

0:52:07.990,0:52:09.220
if you think about the innovation

0:52:09.220,0:52:12.970
process only the problem and being able

0:52:12.970,0:52:15.970
to experiment is a valuable asset here

0:52:15.970,0:52:18.580
you own a problem which is how do you

0:52:18.580,0:52:21.610
get a distributed high-quality education

0:52:21.610,0:52:23.590
experience regardless of socioeconomic

0:52:23.590,0:52:26.650
status and how do you deliver technology

0:52:26.650,0:52:29.830
so you are in a position to do 50

0:52:29.830,0:52:31.660
experiments that the whole world would

0:52:31.660,0:52:33.580
be interested right you're in a position

0:52:33.580,0:52:36.310
to go to the five top online learning

0:52:36.310,0:52:38.200
companies mostly in the united states

0:52:38.200,0:52:41.290
and say we we want to do an asset of

0:52:41.290,0:52:43.390
national experiments and we have a

0:52:43.390,0:52:44.980
national innovation agenda we want to

0:52:44.980,0:52:47.350
link education and innovation so this

0:52:47.350,0:52:49.390
again finally and ultimately relates to

0:52:49.390,0:52:51.640
the stewardship question which is who's

0:52:51.640,0:52:53.920
going to do this work right you have a

0:52:53.920,0:52:55.930
couple of part-time people who spend

0:52:55.930,0:52:57.730
five hours a week it's not going to

0:52:57.730,0:52:58.360
happen

0:52:58.360,0:53:00.370
this requires real work just like

0:53:00.370,0:53:02.620
playing the piano requires real

0:53:02.620,0:53:04.810
practicing but at the end there's the

0:53:04.810,0:53:08.920
potential of huge results no solamente

2010 creado por lo well so first of all

0:54:14.380,0:54:15.940
I want to just quickly make a

0:54:15.940,0:54:17.890
distinction between clusters and hubs

0:54:17.890,0:54:20.170
Leslie theory is well established and

0:54:20.170,0:54:22.690
primarily is about taking an existing

0:54:22.690,0:54:24.280
set of assets and trying to figure out

0:54:24.280,0:54:26.680
how to make them better but to me a hub

0:54:26.680,0:54:28.870
is it's just another word but it

0:54:28.870,0:54:31.570
encompasses this notion of disruptive

0:54:31.570,0:54:33.940
innovation as well so when the cluster

0:54:33.940,0:54:36.700
experts went to Bilbao and said do more

0:54:36.700,0:54:38.770
light manufacturing because you know you

0:54:38.770,0:54:40.690
need more of that that might have been

0:54:40.690,0:54:42.940
more incremental innovation approach but

0:54:42.940,0:54:45.400
when somebody said spend 250 million

0:54:45.400,0:54:47.110
dollars building the guggenheim museum

0:54:47.110,0:54:50.170
so spend 50 million dollars on the

0:54:50.170,0:54:52.330
building which nobody had ever seen a

0:54:52.330,0:54:54.280
building like that spent 50 million

0:54:54.280,0:54:56.740
dollars on titanium panels which would

0:54:56.740,0:54:59.740
wrinkle as soon as they saw the air and

0:54:59.740,0:55:01.570
fifty million dollars on pretty strange

0:55:01.570,0:55:04.150
art this was their game-changing play

0:55:04.150,0:55:09.610
that that turned bilbao into a culture

0:55:09.610,0:55:13.810
design innovation creativity hub that

0:55:13.810,0:55:16.090
has had a dramatic impact on the

0:55:16.090,0:55:19.000
trajectory of the whole city so when I

0:55:19.000,0:55:21.310
talk about hubs in my book innovation

0:55:21.310,0:55:23.590
nation it's really to say well first of

0:55:23.590,0:55:26.980
all you inventory what the assets are so

0:55:26.980,0:55:30.160
you think well okay cusco proximity to

0:55:30.160,0:55:31.540
globally significant cultural

0:55:31.540,0:55:35.200
environments burgeoning tourism industry

0:55:35.200,0:55:38.560
what can we build on top of that but

0:55:38.560,0:55:40.540
then also how could we reimagine the

0:55:40.540,0:55:43.420
whole cultural industry right there may

0:55:43.420,0:55:45.310
be other parts of Peru where there are

0:55:45.310,0:55:47.860
other assets that can also lead to the

0:55:47.860,0:55:50.230
development of hubs and also this

0:55:50.230,0:55:51.760
innovation council that I'm now

0:55:51.760,0:55:53.290
imagining you're thinking about setting

0:55:53.290,0:55:55.210
up which would have representation from

0:55:55.210,0:55:57.550
all these different elements of society

0:55:57.550,0:56:00.580
might think about one moonshot you know

0:56:00.580,0:56:03.460
well let's make this part of Peru for

0:56:03.460,0:56:05.710
example our education

0:56:05.710,0:56:09.099
moonshot city-region state you know

0:56:09.099,0:56:12.190
whatever and we will provide the

0:56:12.190,0:56:14.380
resources because the conditions are

0:56:14.380,0:56:16.270
favorable there because the problem

0:56:16.270,0:56:19.060
ownership is so significant and it's so

valuable so that that's an additional

0:56:21.369,0:56:24.190
level of thinking strategically about

0:56:24.190,0:56:28.270
how to make innovation come alive in

0:56:31.900,0:56:34.330
seems to indicate that not only solo

to climb up or don't I come inside so

0:56:43.990,0:56:47.320
the advice I would have is to believe

0:56:47.320,0:56:52.270
that you can write the book and you

0:56:52.270,0:56:53.680
don't have to just go out and read the

0:56:53.680,0:56:56.740
book written by other people in the

0:56:56.740,0:56:59.619
innovation area which then leads to all

0:56:59.619,0:57:01.210
the other challenges i mentioned about

0:57:01.210,0:57:03.130
who's going to do the work how are you

0:57:03.130,0:57:04.780
going to develop the strategy

0:57:04.780,0:57:07.119
what are the moon shots etc etc but once

0:57:07.119,0:57:09.550
you believe that you can write the book

0:57:09.550,0:57:12.339
that you don't have to just read it then

0:57:12.339,0:57:13.390
I think it sets you want a different

0:57:13.390,0:57:15.609
path so I'm going to be around for the

0:57:15.609,0:57:17.890
rest of the day and you know I recognize

0:57:17.890,0:57:19.930
that you know I through a combination of

0:57:19.930,0:57:22.060
this one too many format plus the

0:57:22.060,0:57:24.040
somewhat psychedelic aspect of the

0:57:24.040,0:57:28.540
slideshow there may be some points that

0:57:28.540,0:57:30.400
we've not fully discussed in fact i'm

0:57:30.400,0:57:32.080
sure there's you know this is really

0:57:32.080,0:57:33.820
just scratching the surface every one of

0:57:33.820,0:57:35.710
these topics could be a one-hour keynote

0:57:35.710,0:57:37.810
in a sense but i will be around i'd be

0:57:37.810,0:57:39.460
happy to talk with you i'll be at the

0:57:39.460,0:57:41.500
cocktail reception and I really would

like to learn from you about what you

0:57:43.960,0:57:46.089
think is important in terms of the

this isn't a real map many people think California is really an island off the coast of North America but its speech to the power of your mental models so these days there are many many different flavors of innovation what I'm going to do is abandon my USB port and just do it this way okay so we have reverse innovation which is the flow of innovation from developing to developed countries we have open source innovation large-scale innovation which is a term that i invented to talk about innovation at a societal level user centered innovation which is about the bringing together of design principles with the economy of a given society digital innovation a very big topic how does social networking start to affect the ability of all of us to contribute to an innovation movement within a society indigenous innovation which is China's approach to building intellectual capital within their country their large country as a driver of economic and social development China's you may know has announced that they are spending 1.5 trillion dollars on a whole host of new horizon scientific technology and innovation related areas and finally there's the whole notion of sustainability innovation nike a very well-known company has essentially merged their innovation team with their sustainability team because they see no difference between the two so I think you can see here the richness of innovation but also the challenge because the word means many different things too many different people so let me try to just give you some simple definitions what's going on it feels like there's some something is signaling this thing and it's just telling it to keep going or you know let's just put it on the regular presentation mode i'll take it off ok so just just go over here ok right
